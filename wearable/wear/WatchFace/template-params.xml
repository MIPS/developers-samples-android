            A simple sample that demonstrates watch faces and complications for Wear 2.0.
        </description>

        <intro>
<![CDATA[
This sample demonstrates how to create watch faces for android wear and includes a phone app
and a wearable app. The wearable app has a variety of watch faces including analog, digital,
opengl, interactive, etc. It also includes a watch-side configuration example.
The phone app includes a phone-side configuration example.

The analog watch face demonstrates best practices for using complications in Wear 2.0. It also
includes a configuration Activity for configuring the watch face styles and complications. We
recommend you follow this UX pattern for your own watch faces.

Because watch face apps do not have a default Activity in their project, you will need to set your
Configurations to "Do not launch Activity" for both the Wear and Application modules. If you are
unsure how to do this, please review the "Run Starter project" section in the
[Google Watch Face Code Lab][1].

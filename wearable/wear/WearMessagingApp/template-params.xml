             (e.g. "Hello World", activities, intents)

             Intermediate is for content that covers material a beginner doesn't need
             to know, but that a skilled developer is expected to know.
             (e.g. services, basic styles and theming, sync adapters)

             Advanced is for highly technical content geared towards experienced developers.
             (e.g. performance optimizations, custom views, bluetooth)

             Expert is reserved for highly technical or specialized content, and should
             be used sparingly. (e.g. VPN clients, SELinux, custom instrumentation runners) -->

            Sample demonstrating how to instantiate an ActionBar on Android, define
            action items, and set an "up" navigation link. Uses the Support Library
            for compatibility with pre-3.0 devices.
